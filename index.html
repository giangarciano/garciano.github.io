				<h1>My thoughts on the current situation</h1>
				<p>This situation is easily manageable as humanity has overcome multiple pandemics. The only reason the number of cases inflated
				is because some governments' handled this situation badly. The Philippines' government prioritized other "problems". This affected the
				Filipinos greatly. If everyone cooperates, we could easily fix this and come back to the old normal. However, not everyone will cooperate
				as they have their own reasons. We cannot simply say "obey the government for everyone", as they can just say no. I honestly think that
				my solution to it could work, however it would be inhuman and it will take a lot of resources. However, there are also a lot of flaws for my
				solution. What if there are too many people that got infected by covid? How will we fit them all in the crematorium? How would we have
				enough potassium nitrate? Would we have enough carbon monoxide? Would we fit enough people into the room? If we did fit enough people there, the person conducting the processes would have a huge chance of gettng infected. </p>
